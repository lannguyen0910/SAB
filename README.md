SlackBot can communicate with users. It can send messages, detect bad words and help you search things within Slack using Yelp - API Search

[yelp](https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fv3%2Fmanage_app): set up search engine **(Make sure to use VPN (America region,..) because they don't allow users with Asia or Africa IP addresses to sign up for an account)** -->
